Store your commands in one place for automatic
or manual launch and execution at any time.

It is convenient to store and run many commands for
automatic execution after system installation.

Recommended for use on `*nix` systems.

Possibilities:

- Storing named packages of commands in one file.
- Launching the execution of a batch or batch of commands from a file in automatic or manual mode.
- Add and run only certain packages.
- Exclusion of certain command packages from launch.
- Ability to run and skip command packets and individual commands in manual mode.

***

___File___ - a file in format 1 or 2 with the correct structure.

***

___A command package___ - name for grouping commands in a file.

***

___Command___ - a command to be executed in the console or terminal.

***

Create one or several files and store the necessary commands 
in them under names (in packages).  
The file must have the correct structure. 
At the moment, the simplest `*.cfg` and `*.json` are supported.

The file must have the correct structure.

***

`*.cfg` - The simplest file with command packages:

    [package name 1]
    command 1
    command 2
    command N
    [package name 2]
    command 1
    command 2
    command N

***

`*.json` - The simplest file with command packages:

```json
{
    "pack1":
      [
        "command1",
        "command2"
      ],
    "pack2":
      [
        "command1",
        "command2"
      ]
}
```

***

Packages:

Package names are placed in square brackets,
below the name are the commands included in this package.

***

Commands:

The commands are grouped under the desired names in packages.

***

To run the file use the command:

`python commandmanager.py [arguments] [file]`

A warning! If the file name contains spaces or invalid characters,
when typing a terminal, enclose it in quotation marks.

***

Arguments:

Using the `-a` option when starting the utility,
you can specify which command package to run using
the existing package name from the file. Use the option multiple
times to add multiple packages:

`python commandmanager.py -a name1 -a name2 -a name3 file.cfg`

Using the `-e` parameter, you can specify which command package
to exclude using the existing package name from the file.
Use the option multiple times to exclude multiple packages:

`python commandmanager.py -e name1 -e name2 -e name3 file.cfg`

A warning! If the command package name contains spaces or invalid characters,
when typing a terminal, enclose it in quotation marks.

The `--no-auto` option will cancel autorun of commands from the package.

Before executing each package and each command
the utility will ask for permission to execute.

The default is to autorun packages and commands `--auto`.

***
